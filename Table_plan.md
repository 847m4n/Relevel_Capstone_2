**There are 5 customer plans**:
**Trial**— Customers sign up for a 7-day free trial and will be automatically enrolled in the pro monthly subscription plan
unless they unsubscribe, downgrade to basic, or upgrade to an annual pro plan during the trial.
**Basic plan** — Customers have limited access and can only stream their videos with the basic package, which is only
available monthly for $9.90.
**Pro plan** — Customers on the Pro plan have no watch time limits and can download videos for offline viewing. Pro
plans begin at $19.90 per month or $199 for a yearly subscription.

When clients cancel their Foodie-Fi service, a Churn plan record with a null pricing is created, but their plan continues
until the end of the billing cycle.
